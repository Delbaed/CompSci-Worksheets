# CompSci-Worksheets
Here is a compilation of compsci materials I have created and compiled myself from various sources: eg: Leaving Cert questions, free online pdfs, and some of my own questions.

I use draw.io for creating my worksheets and diagrams.
All material is created by me unless stated otherwise.
Feel free to download, share, distirbute and use my worksheets as you please.

My list of sources so far are:
1. past leaving certificate questions from examinations.ie exam material archive
2. Wikipedia articles
